    <h1>Our Church History</h1>
    <div class="history-section">
      <p>
        <strong>The Fellowship Church</strong> has a rich and blessed history that began in the early days of Indian independence.
        The vision of creating a Christ-centered community was born in the heart of <strong>Pastor John Matthew</strong>, who
        gathered a small group of believers under one roof in the year <strong>1947</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Beginning</h2>
      <p>
        With limited resources but abundant faith, the first service was conducted in a humble prayer hall.
        Through God's grace, the church began to grow steadily, touching lives across generations.
      </p>

      <h2>Growth Over the Years</h2>
      <p>
        Over the decades, The Fellowship Church became a cornerstone for spiritual revival in Hyderabad.
        By the 1980s, new branches had been established and hundreds were attending Sunday services.
        Music, worship, and community outreach became the core of our identity.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy of Faith</h2>
      <p>
        Today, we continue to live by our motto: <em>"All One in Christ"</em>. We honor the legacy
        of our founders and carry forward the mission of faith, unity, and love. Each lyric sung and
        each soul touched is a testimony of our journey through time.
